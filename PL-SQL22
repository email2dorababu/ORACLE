Parameters for PL/sql procedure:

Call pl/sql procedure by
1) exec helloworld;
2) from annonymous block
  begin
  helloworld;
  end;
  
Is there any way to trasfer data from calling environment to procedure OR from Procedure to Calling environment?
(Imp - VICE VERSA??)
3 types of parameters.
IN mode - we can a send a constant value from the calling env to  the procedure.and the reverse is OUT
OUT - we can send a value from procedure to calling environment.
INOUT - we can send a variable from calling env to procedure and in the same variable we can get something back from the procedure to calling env.
Example for all 3 cases:

create or replace procedure hw( p_name IN varchar2)as
begin
  DBMS_out.PUT_line('hello'||p_name);
end;

exec hw("abc");
Here just after procedure name we are going  to give a parameter name p_name of IN variable of type varchar2.
when we are executing the program, a variable p_name is created and the value of p_name is coming from the calling env.

OUT varable:

create or replace procedure hw( p_a IN number, p_b IN number,
,p_out OUT NUMBER
)as
begin
  DBMS_out.PUT_line('hello'||p_name);
  p_out:=p_a+p_b;
end;

declare
  x number;
begin
  hw(7,8,x);
  dbms_output.put_line(" the result is"||x);
end;
