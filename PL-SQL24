Problem statemnt:
you are asked to generate a randon number between 100 and 1000. if the randon number generated is even then insert that vakuye ti a table called to a table even_table,.
If the genrated number is odd then insert to a table called odd_tab.

now you have written a annonymous block.
decalre
 number;
  begin
  //code to get a random value
  x:=dbms_random.value(100,1000);
  // code to determoine of number is eve
  if(mod(x,2)=0) then
  number is even
  else 
  number is odd
  end if;
  // code tp insert
  if x is even then
    insert into even_tab;
  else insertinto odd_tab;
  end if;
  end;
  
  now you have another question that test 78 is even or odd.
  now you will write another annponymouse block with if condition to test that.
  
  Now if you observe the above code is doing 3 things.
  task 1 is generate random number.
  task 2 is findout if numer is evenor odd
  task 3 is insert into the table.
  
  we can modularize the code into sub programs, given in task1,2,3.
  if you modularize you can solve both question 1 and question 2.
  
  the above is a veyr simple problem.
  when ever incase of HR applicaiton for big organization(enterprise applications), that can constist of 1000s of subprogram,
  it is better to organize.
  say soem 200 subprograms are doing similar kind of functionality/task, then bundle them into a container and that container called package.
