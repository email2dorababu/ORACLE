CURSOR PARAMETERS:

instead of hardcoding the values in cursors, and to avoid writing mutiple cursors, we use crusor parameters.
to give the value at the runtime.

Parameterized cursor or cursor parameters we use.

DECLARE
  cursor c1(v_deptno NUMBER) is --declaring the v_deptno and its datatype.
    select ename,sal
    from emp
    where deptno=v_deptno;    -- here i put v_deptno which is cursor variable here.
    begin 
      for rec in c1(10) loop  -- here i give the value of the parameter. now the select query changes.
        dbms_output.put_line()
        end loop;
    end
    
    ---- now one mor equestion is first print department no and then employees in that deplartment. this repeated 
    for all departments.
    
    sol is to : first cursor to fetch all departments and second cursor is parameterised where we pass the department no
    as a parameter to the second cursor were i fetch the employees.
    
    declare
    cursor c_dept is 
    select distinct deptno
    from dept;
    
    cursor c1(v_deptnp number) is 
    select ename,sa1
    from emp
    where deptno=v_depto;
    
    begin
      for dept_rec in c_dept loop
       dbms_output.putl_line(... || dept_rec.deptno);
       for rec in c1(dept_rec.deptno) loop
        dbms_outpur.put_line('emp:|| rec.ename || has sal || rec.sal);
        end loop;
        end loop;
      end;
