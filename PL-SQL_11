REFerence CURSORs

Prevoiousely we have learnt 
simple cursor, declared a cursor and used for loop to access the cursor, here we know the query at the execution time.
Declare 
cursot C1 is 
  select ename,sal
  from emp;
  begin
  for rec in c1 loop
    
  end loop;
  end;
Cursor with parameters: where we donot know the query at declaration, and the query is determined run time.
we use parameterized cursor. Here we modify the where condition.
Declare 
cursot C1(v_deptno NUMBER) is 
  select ename,sal
  from emp;
  where deptno=v_deptno;
  begin
  for rec in c1(10) loop
    
  end loop;
  end;

Reference Cursor: it is define one cursor, attach the query at run time to the cursor.
here refcursor i donot know the query at declare time, only known at run time. i can create the query dynamically at runtime
based on some conditions/situations.
Example:
Here i declare a type, a new type , of a REF cursor;
and declare a variable of refcursor type.
DECLARE
TYPE emp_refcursor IS REF CURSOR;
  emp_cv emp_refcursor;  
  emprec emp%ROWTYPE;
  
  stmt varchar2(200):='select * from emp';
  v_deptno NUMBER := 10;
BEGIN
  IF v_deptno IS NULL then OPEN emp_cv for stmt;
    else
      stmt:= stmt || ' where deptno = :v_deptno;
      
      Open emp_cv for stmt Using v_deptno;  --- here we are using the varibale v_deptno.
  end if;
  LOOP
    FETCH emp_cv into emprec;
    exit when emp_cv%notfound;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(emprec.deptno||'..'||emprec.ename);
    END LOOP;
    CLOSE emp_cv;
    END;
    
    Simple cursor - select query is completely known at declare time
    Parameterized cursor the query is almost defined at declare time
    Here ref cursor, we donot know even what is the query at all.
    
  Now in the above programm emp_cv is the active set contains the employees.
  and we are going to loop through the cursor, and exit when finished.
  
  The ref cursor makes your program more flexible and you can use only one cursor, 
  you can associate the qeury at runtime and once it is done u can close the cursor and use the same cursor
  emp_cv again with diff query.
  
  Use must use the ref cursor when the select query is compeltely not known at the declaration time.
