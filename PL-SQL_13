PL/sql Records Data type

PL/sql data types are (Over All view)
1) Scalar data type (number,varchar,date etc)
2) pl/sql composite data type (2 types)
  i) PL/sql records
  ii)pl/sql Collections (3 types)
    a) associative array or index by table or pl/sql Table
    b) Nested Table
    c) VARRAY
  
Here in this tutorial we are going to discuss PL/SQL Records.
----------
f we know that we need 5 diff variables, instead of declaring them separately,we can declare a pl/sql records.

Declare
  TYPE ABC is RECORD of (a number, b date);
x ABC;
This ABC is abstract data type which is a combination of number and date.
Here x is a box and can contain two stocks at a time. box have 2 compartments, one contains number and another contain a date.
initially both contain NULL.

BEGIN
  x.a :=5;
  x.b:='19-Jan-1901';
  
END;

here we are packing the data together.
ex: transport each differently or pack everything in one and transport.

The above is about record datatype. The declartion ABC is like .class and X is like object.

DECLARE
TYPE rec1_t is REcord(id integer not null :=-1, name varchar2(64) NOT null :='AAA');
rect1 rect1_t;
begin
  rect1.name:='abc';
  DBMS_OOUTPUT.PUT_LINE(rec1.name);
  END;
  
--------------
Selecting into a RECORD variable
DECLARE
TYPE recordTyp is RECTORD(name emp.ename%TYPE, id emp.empno%TYPE);
rec1 recordTyp;
BEGIN 
  select ename,empno INTO rec1 from emp where empno=7839;
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE("Emp name"|| rec1.id||'='|| rec1.name);
END;
-------------------
INSERTING a pl/sql Record
DECLARE
  empt_info departmemt%ROWTYPE;  //here it a Record.
BEGIN
  dept_info.dept_id:=300;
  dept_info.department_name:='Personal';
  dept_info.location_id:=1700;
  INSERT INTO department values dept_info;
  END;
