Collection type - Index by Table.

we already discussed varray(fixed size) and nested table , which is array unbounded.

Here both the above the index is a number and goes in sequence.
However we need to store some kind of key value pairs. this kind of data structure , called ASSOCIATIVE ARRAY more popularly known as 
INDEX by TABLE.
This stores a key value pair. and this key is unique key.

DECLARE 
TYPE ABC is table of NUMBER INDEX by PLS_INTEGER; --- means what ever table is created the key is integer and value is number data type.
TYPE PQR is table of NUMBER index by VARCHAR2(20);
