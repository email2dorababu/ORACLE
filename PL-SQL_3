Character sets and lexical units:


Pl/sql engine supports 4 diff character sets 
letters(A-z and a-z)
digits (0-9)
symbols(%,& +,-)
white spaces(carriage returns etc)

Excepts the back quotes all other types are supported by pl/sql block
The diff characters combinely make a work and that is called lexical units.
4 diff types of lexical units.
1) 20+ delimiters,
2) Identifiers (variables and reserverd keyworkds) 
 ruls are - 1. can contain upto 30 characters
            2. must begin with an alphabetic char 3. con contain numerals, dollor sign underscores and number signs
            4.cannot contain characters such as hyphens , slashes and spaces 5.should not have the same name as a database table column name
            6.should not be reserverd words.
3) literals - exlicit numeric char, string or boolean value not represented by identifier.    
'hello world' TRUE 'Z",6 -14 etc
4) Comments

Let us identify the lexical units:

DECLARE  - I
count PLS_integer:=1 count is I and  pls is identifier , := is delimiter  and 1 is numerical literal
BEGIN -I
 LOOP -I
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('A'); + is delimiter and 'A' is char literal etc
