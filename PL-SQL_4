PLS-4: PL/SQL Variables
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS4pQAAabHo

Variables are used to 
store temporary data   a:=5+10
manipulation of stored values a:=a*5;
reusability    a=5 then later point a=10 
ease of maintenance - program is very easy to reand and maintain.

Types or variables :
1.PL/sql variables  4 types
scalar - we can store one data at  a time. you tell me what data it is , number, date, varchar, int ..
composite - i can store multiple things in one data, it is like a structure in C.(5,'xyz' you can store)
reference - we do not know what kind of varible is this in compile time.we attach it to a table column type.At run time we will get what is the column type.
LOB(large object) - we can store unstructure data, lot of support for unstructure data

Now some times , we call pl/sql pgm from another language like in c, java,perl etc. This language is called HOST language.
we can pass the variable to pl/sql these variables called Bind/Host variable.

2.non pl/sql variables
-Bind variables
-Host variables
-----------------------------------------
Sclar variables
Number, boolean , constant number(3,2), assignment operator :=, VARCHAR2
constant value never changes during the program execution.
Note: done:=(counter=1) here it is not double equlato for comparision. it is single equal to for comparision.

------------------------
Reference variables:
wages emp.sal%TYPE;  what ever emp.sal datatype , the wages will have same datatype. In run time it is going to db and finds the type by pl/sql compiler.
------
Composite data type:
Declare 
  TYPE rec is RECORD (    -- the composite data type we defined a new data type 'rec' is its name.
      a number,           -- i declare v_rec of that data type.
      b varchar2(10)) ;
  v_rec rec;     
  
  emp_rec emp%RowType;  -- here it is of a table row type emp_rec is of table row type.
  
  -- emp_rec contains multiple elements , name, job, salary etc .. it is a composite datatype of reference type.
  -- we don't know type of emp_rec at cmpile time.
    BEGIN
    v_rec.a:=10; -- how to access?? is variable v_rec.element_name
    emp_rec.sal:=90;
  end;

The composite datatype gives flexibility of using the datatypes we can use.
-------
Host data type.
we show using the command prompt
SQL>conn scott/tiger
here we dclare a variable
sql> variable g_sal Number
> begin
  select sal
  into :g_sal -- colon g_sal 
  from emp
  where emp_no=7369;
  end
/
>print g_sal
Here instead of simple g_sal , we have used colon g_sal. The salary is stored into the g_sal variable.

the g_sql is host variable.
