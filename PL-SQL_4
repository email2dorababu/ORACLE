PLS-4: PL/SQL Variables
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS4pQAAabHo

Variables are used to 
store temporary data   a:=5+10
manipulation of stored values a:=a*5;
reusability    a=5 then later point a=10 
ease of maintenance - program is very easy to reand and maintain.

Types or variables :
1.PL/sql variables  4 types
scalar - we can store one data at  a time. you tell me what data it is , number, date, varchar, int ..
composite - i can store multiple things in one data, it is like a structure in C.(5,'xyz' you can store)
reference - we do not know what kind of varible is this in compile time.we attach it to a table column type.At run time we will get what is the column type.
LOB(large object) - we can store unstructure data, lot of support for unstructure data

Now some times , we call pl/sql pgm from another language like in c, java,perl etc. This language is called HOST language.
we can pass the variable to pl/sql these variables called Bind/Host variable.

2.non pl/sql variables
-Bind variables
-Host variables
-----------------------------------------
Number, boolean , constant number(3,2), assignment operator :=, VARCHAR2
constant value never changes during the program execution.
done:=(counter=1) here it is not double equlato for comparision. it is single equal to for comparision.
