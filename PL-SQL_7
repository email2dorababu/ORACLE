COntrol Sturctures
Why we need control sturctures in any programming language?

Conditions/Selection control -->Take alternative actions depending on circumstances(IF then else)
and to choose among several values(CASE).

There are 3 ways we can implement selection.
1. Selection  (here in this video we explain Selection)
2.Iteration
3.Sequence

See the oracle database reference

Simple IF-Then statement:

if sales>(quota+200) then
  update employees set sal=sal+bonus
  where emp_id =emp_id

end if;  -- note that here we have to give a semicolon.

IF-THEN-ELSE statement.
IF  then
ELSE
END IF;
NESTED IF-THEN-ELSE statement:
IF then
else
    IF then
    else
    end if;
end if;

The above is little difficult to write and odd looking. and not good programming practice.
for thsi oracle came up with:
IF-THEN ELSIF statement

if then
elsif then
else
end if;
extended if-then statement
if then
elsif then
elsif then
elsif then
else
end if;

---------------------------------
CASE statememt- like if statement, selects one squence of statements to execute.
However to select the sequence the case statement uses a selector rather than multiple boolean expressons.
declare
begin
Case grade
when 'A' then 
when 'B' then
else 
end case;
end;
