ITERATION:
Question: find out square of numbers from 1 to 10:

Basic structure of Iteration in oracle is LOOP.

LOOP
END LOOP;

The statements inside the above will run indefinitely.
You have to give the condition when you want to come out.otherwise you never come out of loop.

LOOP
IF x>3 then
  EXIT;
  END IF;
END LOOP;
When ever control hits exit then it simply goes to the next statement after END loop.

you can write the same above program with EXIT WHEN clause.

LOOP
 exit when x>3;
END LOOP;

CONTINUE: statement: Exit statement will take you to next line of END LOOP.
The reverse is continue.COntinue will take you to the begennig of the loop. i.e next line of LOOP.

EXIT -> line next to END LOOP;
CONTIUE -> Line next to LOOP
Similar to EXIT WHEN you have CONTINUE WHEN.
----------------------
We can label a loop:
Before you write a loop you can put a lable within doube less than and double greater than.
<<outer_loop>>
LOOP
  <<inner_Loop>>
  LOOP
 exit inner_loop when (j>5); you will tell which loop to exit, this will give greater control.
 exit outer_loop when (j>5);
end loop inner_loop;
end loop outer_loop;
--------------------------
WHILE LOOP:

WHILE (I<10) LOOP
END LOOP:
-----
FOR LOOP

FOR i in 1..10 LOOP  
  i is  a tem variable implicitly declared with lower and upper bound
  and i is automatically increemented by i.
END LOOP;
-----
Reverse for loop: just a keywork reverse:
FOR i in REVERSE 1..3 LOOP
END LOOP;
equivalant to --- for i in 3..1 loop
------------
for step in 0..(trunc(high/low)*2) loop
end loop;

select count(emp_id) into emp_count from table;

for i in 1..emp_count LOOP  here specify the upper bound at runtime
END loop;
