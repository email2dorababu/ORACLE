ITERATION:
Question: find out square of numbers from 1 to 10:

Basic structure of Iteration in oracle is LOOP.

LOOP
END LOOP;

The statements inside the above will run indefinitely.
You have to give the condition when you want to come out.otherwise you never come out of loop.

LOOP
IF x>3 then
  EXIT;
  END IF;
END LOOP;
When ever control hits exit then it simply goes to the next statement after END loop.

you can write the same above program with EXIT WHEN clause.

LOOP
 exit when x>3;
END LOOP;

CONTINUE: statement: Exit statement will take you to next line of END LOOP.
The reverse is continue.COntinue will take you to the begennig of the loop. i.e next line of LOOP.
